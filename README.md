# Hej Buss!

[Hej Buss](https://hejbuss.now.sh)! is a small and stupid hack using [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/):s trainable natural language understanding to answer freeform VÃ¤sttrafik speech/text queries with next matching departure.

It can currently only answer questions like: 
`NÃ¤sta tur frÃ¥n Nordstan till Ullevi Norra`
or `NÃ¤sta tur till Ullevi Norra` in which case it will find the next departure from your nearest stop.

Since this is was just a quick hack, it has basically no error handling. But as long as you stick to the happy path, it might just as well work... if you're using a very modern browser that is â€“Â I've only tested it in Chrome 58 ðŸ˜¬
